# dental-patient-response-tool
An interactive tool to help dentists communicate with patients during procedures using a tablet-based interface.
## 🚀 Vision

During dental treatments, patients are often unable to speak. This tool provides an intuitive way for patients to respond to questions (like "Is this painful?" or "Can you feel this?") using a digital interface. It enhances comfort, trust, and treatment accuracy.

## 🧩 Features

### ✅ Core Features
- Touchscreen interface for patients
- Buttons: Yes / No / Stop / Pain Level (1–5)
- Dentist dashboard to send common questions
- Real-time feedback alerts (visual/audio/vibration)
- Works offline – no Wi-Fi needed

### 🌟 Optional/Future Features
- Child mode with icons/emojis
- Accessibility options (large text, color contrast)
- Multi-language support
- Voice assistant for dentists
- Eye tracking or gesture input for non-touch users
- Session data logging

## 📱 Use Case

1. The dentist selects a question (e.g., "Is this too painful?")
2. Patient responds via tablet with a single tap
3. The dentist receives immediate feedback and adjusts accordingly

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Guide

- Flutter (preferred) or React Native
